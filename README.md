# The curse of dimensionality

In machine learning, high-dimensional data refers to data with a large number of features or variables. The curse of dimensionality is a common problem in machine learning, where -

    1. The performance of the model deteriorates as the number of features increases.
    2. Complexity of the model increases with the number of features.
    3. High-dimensional data can also lead to overfitting.

  # Two main approaches to dimensionality reduction: 

    1. Feature Selection: selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the problem at hand.
    
    2. Feature Extraction: creating new features by combining or transforming the original features.
